### To The Hell
###### Logical line
A collectible card game, 3D Rogue-like about the ancient Greek Orpheus, who descends into Hell for his beloved.
###### Synopsis
Orpheus and Eurydice wanted to marry and were in the grove when the girl was bitten by a poisonous snake.

The young man was in despair and went to the realm of the dead to find Eurydice. The hero finds the entrance 
to Hell and begins to descend, but the way is blocked by the servants of Hades. Orpheus begins to play the harp,
and his music is capable of harming demons.

Orpheus meets a demon cat who begs for mercy in exchange for a tour of Hell and help, as the cat needs to go down.

Orpheus and a cat named Milipusik are looking for a way to get to Hades, who ordered all Hell to resist Orpheus. They meet a strange creature that refuses to fight and just hisses. It turns out that such a creature can be exorcised by the music of Orpheus, if he wants to. Milipusik translates the demon's whisper that Orpheus is their hope.
